# Project context for Claude

## What this is

A self-hosted [newserv](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/newserv) deployment
on AWS Lightsail — Phantasy Star Online private server for the maintainer's
friends. Plus a public dashboard at <https://pso.joshkautz.com> showing server
status, the quest catalog, and registered players.

Not a fork of newserv; the upstream image is consumed unchanged via GHCR.
"Custom" lives in this repo only — Terraform, Docker compose, the dashboard,
client-setup docs, the deploy pipeline.

## Repository layout

```
infra/                    Terraform — Lightsail instance, static IP, firewall,
                          OIDC role for GH Actions, S3 backup bucket
server/                   newserv-side config — system/ overlay, cloud-init.sh,
                          backup script + systemd timer/service
server/config.json        newserv runtime config. HTTPListen[8081] gives the
                          dashboard backend its REST hop.

## Tech stack

| Layer | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud | AWS Lightsail (us-east-1, `small_3_0`, ~$12/mo) | Lightsail Instance, not Container Service — need raw UDP 53 / TCP for game ports |
| IaC | Terraform 1.10+ with S3 state backend | OIDC role for GH Actions |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Path-filtered triggers; deploy via SSH + scp + docker compose |
| Containers | Docker compose on the Lightsail box | One bridge network, no host ports for newserv REST |
| Reverse proxy / TLS | Caddy 2 (caddy:2-alpine) | Auto Let's Encrypt, redirects HTTP → HTTPS |
| PSO server | newserv (fuzziqersoftware/newserv) | Image pinned by tag, upstream master via build-image.yml |
| Dashboard backend | Node 22 + Express 4 | ESM modules, `npm run dev` is `node --watch` |
| Dashboard frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no framework | Single file, no build step |
| DNS | Squarespace (formerly Google Domains) | A record `pso.joshkautz.com` → static IP |

## Conventions

### newserv data shape — PascalCase

newserv emits PascalCase JSON keys: `Server.ClientCount`, `Quests[].Metadata.Episode`,
`a.LastPlayerName`. The dashboard must match what newserv sends — don't pre-
normalise to snake_case anywhere in the adapter or the page silently fails to
populate. There was a long-running bug where the dashboard read
`s.connected_clients` and silently fell back to mock numbers because the real
field was `s.Server.ClientCount`. Don't repeat that.

### No mock data on screen

`MOCK_GAMES` / `MOCK_DROPS` are empty arrays. There used to be hardcoded
`7 hunters online` / `42 accounts` etc. as static HTML; they silently looked
like real numbers when JS broke. Initial render shows empty state or `—`,
which the API overwrites within ~100ms. If the API is down, you see an honest
empty state. Don't reintroduce static placeholders that look like real values.

### Escape user-supplied strings

Quest names, descriptions, player names come from API JSON. They could in
principle contain `<`, `&`, `'`, `"`. Always pass through `escapeHtml()`
before interpolating into `innerHTML`. Don't bypass.

### Sanitisers, not allowlists alone

Every entry in `dashboard/server.js`'s `ALLOWLIST` map has a `strip` function
that mutates the upstream response before it leaves the backend. Even if a
route looks safe, write a sanitiser. Examples of what gets dropped: PSO
serial numbers, access keys, passwords, IP addresses, account IDs, session
tokens, ban times, internal flags.

`/y/shell-exec` and any POST routes are off-limits — adding them is a hard
"talk to me first" change.

### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA contrast. Semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`,
`<nav>`, `<footer>`). Visible `:focus-visible` rings, never removed.
`prefers-reduced-motion` respected. Quest cards are `role="button"` +
`aria-haspopup="dialog"` + keyboard-activatable. Modal uses native `<dialog>`
for built-in focus trap. Countdown timer refreshes `aria-label` only on day
boundaries — never spam screen readers per second.

### Commit messages

Conventional `area: imperative description`. Body explains *why* (not *what*
the diff already shows). No emoji. No mention of Claude / Claude Code / AI
in commit or PR text — read as if a human engineer wrote it. See per-user
rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### Git safety

- Never `push --force` to `main`, never `reset --hard` without asking.
- Never disable GPG signing. If the 1Password SSH agent fails, retry the
  same command.
- Never skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`).
- Prefer small focused commits over large ones.

```

## How `NEWSERV_REV` reaches the browser

The dashboard's identity card shows `newserv abc1234 (up to date)`. The SHA
flow:

1. `build-image.yml` checks out `fuzziqersoftware/newserv` at `master`,
   captures `git rev-parse HEAD`, passes it to `docker/build-push-action`'s
   `labels:` input as `org.opencontainers.image.revision`.
2. `deploy.yml` runs `docker inspect ghcr.io/joshkautz/pso-server:main
   --format '{{ index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision" }}'`,
   writes `NEWSERV_REV=<sha>` to `/home/ubuntu/pso-server/.env`.
3. `docker-compose.yml` interpolates `${NEWSERV_REV:-unknown}` into the
   dashboard's `environment:` block.
4. `dashboard/server.js` reads `process.env.NEWSERV_REV`, surfaces it via
   `/api/build` alongside the upstream master SHA from GitHub (cached 1h).
5. The frontend renders the comparison and links to the GitHub compare view
   if the deploy is behind.

If any step breaks, the identity card shows `newserv —` — never a misleading
value.

## What's deferred to upstream changes

Tracked as separate tasks; mention if relevant during planning.

- **#70 Full character data** — newserv's `/y/accounts` returns `LastPlayerName`
  per account but no per-character data. Add `GET /y/characters` walking
  `system/players/` and returning sanitized records (name, class, race,
  section_id, level, ATP/DFP/MST/ATA/EVP/LCK stats, HP/TP) for all 4 slots
  per account. Requires re-forking `fuzziqersoftware/newserv` and writing
  ~100-200 lines of C++ in `src/HTTPServer.cc` + a walker helper. PR upstream.
- **#61 Per-quest + per-player completion tracking** — pair with #70 since
  both touch the same character-file walker. Adds
  `GET /y/data/quest/:num/completions` reading `FlagsArray<0x400>` at offset
  `0x460` in each character file, returning the character-name list with
  that quest's bit set. Dashboard modal's "Completed by" placeholder is
  already in place and just needs the data.
- **#60 Rare-drops WebSocket bridge** — newserv exposes
  `WS /y/rare-drops/stream`; dashboard needs WS proxy support in `server.js`
  (the existing HTTP allowlist doesn't cover WebSockets).

## Quest provenance — important context

`dashboard/quest-provenance.json` overrides the default CategoryID-based
source classification on a per-quest basis. Why this exists: web research
turned up that 9 of the 11 quests under newserv's CategoryID 21 ("Download")
bucket are *Sega-authored* DC/GC download quests, not fan-made. The Download
category is about distribution channel, not authorship. The provenance file
maps those 9 to `classify: "original"` so they appear under "Original game"
instead of "Fan-made" on the dashboard.

When community packs land via `server/quests/download/`, add their entries
to this file mapping quest numbers to attribution. Only genuinely fan-made
quests should get `classify: "community"`.
